# Automate AWS S3 Bucket Creation and File Upload with Terraform

This repository demonstrates how to use Terraform to automate the creation of an AWS S3 bucket and upload files to it. The process also integrates a remote backend for managing the Terraform state.

## Prerequisites

- **Terraform Installed**: [Download Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).
- **AWS Credentials Configured**: Run `aws configure` to set up access.
- **Basic Knowledge of Terraform**: Familiarity with HCL syntax.

## Features

1. Creates an S3 bucket with a unique name using `random_id`.
2. Uploads a file (`myfile.txt`) to the bucket.
3. Manages Terraform state remotely using an S3 backend.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Update Variables
- Edit the bucket and file paths in the `main.tf` file if necessary.

### 3. Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### 4. Apply the Configuration
```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### 5. Verify in AWS
- Check the S3 bucket and confirm the file upload in the AWS Management Console.

## Key Concepts

- **Backend**: Stores Terraform state remotely for collaboration and reliability.
- **Random ID**: Ensures unique S3 bucket names for global compliance.
- **S3 Bucket & Object**: AWS resources managed via Terraform.

## File Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf        # Main Terraform script
â”œâ”€â”€ myfile.txt     # File to upload
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md      # Documentation
```

## Cleanup

To destroy the created resources, run:
```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## Outputs

- The unique bucket name generated by `random_id`.
